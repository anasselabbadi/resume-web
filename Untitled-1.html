        <p>i'am a beginner in programming. I am 21 years old.
            I obtained a BAC in 2019 in the Division of
             Life and Earth Sciences. I loved programming
              since my first year in high school. I 
              began to learn programming languages and algorithms
               on YouTube. After my graduation, I completed my

            ethical hacking was one of the most challenging and enthusiastic
             magazines for me, and this prompted me to learn more about the 
             it, especially with regard to (auto script,bots,spam,sql_injection)
              all of this made me learn more about programming languages such as
               (SQL,JavaScript,Python)and how it continued My acquaintances in 
               this field i have also worked on websites for companies, including

                  network hacker  based on the Python language I worked on a  virus 
                  (medium to weak strength), I worked on many simple 2D games based 
                  on (max2D) and now I am trying to develop my abilities more and work 
                  in more languages and professionalism, and on the other hand I have 
                  been working on developing my skills and abilities in communication 
                  and The work is collective, as I worked in several restaurants from 
                   most notably (Diafa) where I developed my conversational ability 
                   and confidence in myself. I learned a lot from my experience 
                   with my clients, as I improved my ability to deal with problems 
                   from both sides (the work team or clients) I learned how to control
                    my fear, anger or stress  ..........ect I participated in many
                     charitable works and won many certificates of appreciation, as I
                      consider myself an active person who loves movement and positivity.
